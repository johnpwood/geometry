To construct an equilateral triangle
A triangle that has all its sides equal is equilateral, [1d15] so ABC is equilateral.
Let the given line be AB.
A B AB
With center A and radius AB, draw circle BCD. [p3]
C D BCD
With center B and radius BA, draw circle ACE and call one of the points where they intersect C [p3]
E ACE
Join C and A. [p1]
CA
Join C and B. [p1]
CB
Because AC and AB are radii of the same circle, BCD, they must be equal. [1d15]
AB CB
Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to each other [a1], so all three lines AB, AC, CB, are equal.
AB CB CA
elements:
A P 3.5 5
B P 6.5 5
AB S A B
BCD C A B
ACE C B A
C I BCD ACE
D G BCD
E G ACE
CA S A C
CB S B C
