To draw a line from a given point a line equal to a given line.
Thus, a line, AL, has been drawn from the given point A equal to the given line, BC.
Let the given point be A and the given line BC.
A B C BC
Join A and B. [1.p1]
AB
Draw an equilateral triangle, ADB, on AB. [1.1]
AB AD BD A B D
Draw DA out to E [1.p2]
DE A D
Draw DB out to F [1.p2]
DF D B
Draw circle CGH with center B and radius BC, intersecting line DF at G. [1.p3]
CGH BC B C G H
Draw circle GKL with center D and radius DG, intersecting line DE at L. [1.p3]
GKL G K L D DL
Now BG will be equal to BC, since they are radii of circle CGH. [1.d15]
B C G BG BC CGH
DL will equal DG, since they are radii of of circle GKL. [1.d15]
D L G DL DG GKL
DA was constructed equal to DB, so the remainders, AL and BG will be equal. [1.a3]
A L B G AL BG
If AL is equal to BG, it must also be equal to BC, since BG equals BC. [1.a1]
